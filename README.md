## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javscript

### What I learned

This project taught me the power of CSS animations and JavaScript rendering. I explored CSS animations, mastering keyframe animations and property transitions. With JavaScript, I dynamically updated text, images, and applied animations. This knowledge will enhance future projects, enabling captivating user interfaces and seamless experiences.

### Continued development

In future projects, I will prioritize refining my skills in three key areas: API integration, React framework, and JavaScript proficiency. By focusing on these areas, I aim to build dynamic applications, leverage the power of React for efficient UI development, and enhance my JavaScript expertise.
